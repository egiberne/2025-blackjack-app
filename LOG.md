#100DaysOfCode, Day 12, 11/7/2025
I am continuing to work on the Blackjack project to learn how to make website interactive using Javascript.
Today as part of the project I learnt to :
    - Use loop to render cards of the game by manipulating the DOM
    - Write function that returns value to avoid hard-code values
    - Create an object to store player's profile
